Probability: chance of something favorable occurring:
eg. getting odd number when you roll a dice:  3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Probability distribution:
1. Discrete distribution:
    PMF - Probability Mass Function
    a. What is the probability of getting exect 10 times 5 when I roll a dice 100 times
    CDF - Cumulative Distribution Function
    a. What is the probability of getting 10 or less times 5 when I roll a dice 100 times
    PPF - Percent Point function
    RVS - generates values for the distribution

    Bernouli's distribution - discrete distribution with one event
    p = success probability
    q = failure probability, q = 1-p
    e.g. What's the probability of getting 5 when I roll a dice once
    p = prob of getting 5 = 1/6
    q = prob of not getting 5 = 1 - 1/6  = 5/6

    Binomial distribution: Given n of trials, what is the probability of
    getting k number of favorable trials.

2. Continuous distribution:

We will use Scipy here. You need to install scipy - pip install scipy

Continous distribution
Normal Distribution:

In a certain exam, average marks scored by people appearing is 490
with standard deviation of 20
In what % of ppl I am ahead of, if I score 525
Z score of 525 = (525 - 490) / 20 = 35/20 = 1.75
    from table: -inf to 0 = 0.5
                -inf to -1.75 = 0.0401
                -1.75 to 0 = 0.5 - 0.0401 = 0.4599
                -inf to 1.75 = 0.5 + 0.4599 = 0.9599 = 95.99%
Number of people above me: 1- 95.99%

.... if my score is 510 : (at 1 sigma) = 84%
.... if my score is 530 : (at 2 sigma) = 84%

Population and Sample:
1. You cant access entire population, you decide to work with sample data
2. Once you have your analysis then you need to figure out mechanism to test!
3. test to see if one should believe your data or not

Sampling methods:
 1. Non-stastical method : convenience method, judgemental, snowball, quota sampling
 2. Probabilistic methods : simple random, cluster sampling (create clusters and pick your cluster),
                          systematic sampling, stratified sampling

Hypothesis test:
1. Null Hypothesis (H0) - no impact
2. Alternate Hypothesis (H1) - yes there is impact (+ve or -ve)
3. Result will tell you should you accept or reject Null Hypotheis (based on p value)
    If reject then look at the result and convey if +ve or -ve

ESTIMATION FOR SINGLE POPULATION
1.  Numerical data

We need to use either Z-test or t-test
1.  If Population standard deviation is given and the sample size is >30 : use Z-score to test
2.  Either the population sample is less than 30 or Standard Deviation of population is not available â€“ t-test to test.

Principal says that his 30 students have above average intelligence.
1. GIVEN:
Based on the data:
    1. Mean IQ of the population = 100
    2. Standard deviation is = 15
    3. Mean of the sample (the school in the discussion) = 112
2. PROCESS
H0 => Mean of sample = mean of population
    112 is almost same as 100 =>
    these students of the school has same intelligence level as global mean

H1 => mean of sample > mean of population

3. ALPHA Level (Confidence level) - 95%
Z Score of 1.645 [@ alpha level 0.95 - for one tailed test]

4. Z Score of the data:
Z test =  (sample mean - pop mean)/ (sd / root of n)
where n is number of samples
(112 - 100)/(15 / root of 30)
12 / (15/5.477)
Z = 4.38

Since Z score is greater than alpha value, we reject Null Hypothesis

Population mean of 100 glucose level with sd of 15
Sample of 30 - and after a certain diet their glucose level went uptp 140

Prove that specific diet has an impact on the glucose level

This problem is different to previous problem because here,
 we are interested in performing 2 Tailed test and in the above school
 example, we were focused on one tailed (higher value)

 Since its a 2-tailed test, we are dividing the alpha value by 2
 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 
 Z value here is 1.96

 Z -test: 14.6 - this is greater than z value so we reject the Null Hypothesis

Population mean = 2.5
Sample mean = 3.2
SD of pop = 1.1
 n = 18
Since n <30, we will use t-score to test
Test: Is the mean (3.2) abnormally high?
t-score = (Pop mean - sample mean)/ Standard Error
SE = SD/root n = 1.1/root 18 =0.259
t-score= -2.7
The t-score at DF 17 is less than 0.01 which indicates, we reject Null Hypothesis
So the statement made is True
